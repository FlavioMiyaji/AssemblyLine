# Written response

## What do I think of this exam?
I think this is a very good challenge, here it's possible to write a high-quality and simple solutiom, pratice the basic of React, TypeScript and automated Testing utilizing the latest and reliable libraries. I made my challenge based on TDD, and it was easy with the especifications.

## The potential improvement I would do:
I would implement a better UI, probable using Figma so I could test the UX instead of just make what I think is better. But for sure I would change the "Add an item:" input, I would add a button and improve the css. The Assembly "task" I would make a component, so we could add more informations and details. Change the left click and right click for arrow icons.
